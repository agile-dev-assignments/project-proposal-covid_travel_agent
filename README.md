# Project Proposal
## Project Title: Covid Travel Agent
### What and why?
I would like to build a Website Application that helps people feel more confident about travelling in the coming months. COVID has disrupted many industries, but one of the worst hit industries globally is undoubtebly the travel industry. After widespread lockdowns and restrictions, I feel people now more than ever are anxious to get back out in the world.

### For whom?
This software is for intended for anybody and everybody who wishes to travel in the coming months. 

### How?
The goal of the software will be to streamline travel so it's as simple as picking a location and booking a flight again. With all the restrictions now in place, I believe travelling is now at a point where a great deal of research is required before hand. 

This will be achieved by:
1. Collecting User information: current country of residence, country of citizenship
2. Based on user information and real time data compiled from the web, calculating the best travel destination for each user based on: possibility, % of general population vaccinated, flight cost, quarantine periods & other COVID related data (whether you need to test in advance).

### Scope
I believe for this project to be completed to a high standard in the timescale given will require multiple programmers. There is a few complex tasks required to build this software.

1. Building a decision engine: which can be fed real time data, and output decisions about whether a destination is suitable or not and then rank it among other destinations so that the user sees the best travel destinations for them. 

2. Building a clean and easy to user user experience, since the client facing product must be as easy to use as any other travel platform. 

3. Database management - managing real time data on the back end and continually evolving recommendations.
